ðŸš€ Welcome aboard, Spaceman! ðŸš€

As a crypto enthusiast navigating the vast universe of DeFi, you need a reliable spaceship equipped with the most advanced tools. Our project is designed to be your trusted companion in this journey, enhancing your DeFi experience by making it smoother, safer, and more profitable. Here's a detailed overview of our project, categorized by each of our esteemed sponsors:

[NextId](#nextid) | [XMTP](#xmtp) | [Push Protocol](#push-protocol) | [Gnosis Safe](#gnosis-safe) | [Uniswap](#uniswap) | [Spark Lend](#spark-lend) | [ApeCoin](#apecoin) | [zkEVM](#zkevm) | [Scroll Testnet](#scroll-testnet) | [Mantle](#mantle)

## NextId
Our user interface, designed like a spaceship command center, provides an immersive and interactive experience. It leverages the NextId RelationService API for fetching user's information and facilitates real-time communication within the interface. This integration has made it easier to search for users, enhancing the overall user experience.

## XMTP
We've taken XMTP chat to the next level by creating a fork that works seamlessly with the Mask network. This feature allows users to search any connected social accounts and resolve them to an address which can be messaged. We've also integrated Privy, enabling users to conveniently login with their Apple and Google accounts and export their wallet directly from the website!

## Push Protocol
We've integrated the Push Protocol to add push chat and calling features. Now, you can initiate a chat or a call with just a click of a button.

## Gnosis Safe
Our governance module, built with Zodiac avatars, works within the Gnosis Safe. This is a key piece of the puzzle for making governance protocols lindy. We've created a Connext communicator for safes to send messages to each other across chains and execute cross-chain transactions.

## Uniswap
Our liquidation engine works with Stability MAI (sMAI for short). It uses user-staked MAI to liquidate loans and uses UniswapV4 hooks to sell the collateral at a certain MAI price. This integration into the stability pool of MAI allows the stability pool contract to sell into Uniswap when the price is acceptable.

## Spark Lend
Our versatile contract uses interest-bearing assets as collateral in lending protocols. It's compatible with SparkLend, the erc4626 sDAI, and also works with Compound lending. Protocols integrating with us get a cut of the earnings, making it a win-win situation for all.

## ApeCoin
We've innovatively incorporated on-chain achievements into our `Mintable.sol` contract. This enables the creation of unique achievements related to balance, farming, and borrowing. It's all self-service, eliminating the need for trust-based airdrops. Plus, it's fully interoperable, allowing anyone who connects to NFTs to participate. This game-changing feature makes the DeFi space more engaging and rewarding for users. We've also integrated achievements for ApeCoin holders. Prove you own some ApeCoin to earn the NFT!

## Polygon zkEVM
We've deployed an NFT achievements contract to let users earn NFTs for their on-chain activity. We've created a demo and art for ETH holders on zkEVM.


## Scroll Testnet
We've deployed an NFT achievements contract to let users earn NFTs for their on-chain activity. We've created a demo and art for ETH holders on Scroll Testnet.


## Mantle
We've deployed an NFT achievements contract to let users earn NFTs for their on-chain activity. We've created a demo and art for MNT holders on Mantle.

Our codebase also includes contracts and interfaces for vaults and liquidators, among other features. We hope this detailed overview helps you understand our project better!
