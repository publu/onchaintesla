🚀 Welcome to our project! 🚀

We're all about revolutionizing the DeFi space. Our codebase is packed with exciting features, all designed to make your DeFi experience smoother, safer, and more profitable. Let's dive into the details:

👥 User Interface:
Our user interface is welcoming and interactive. It uses the NextId RelationService API to get the user's information and allows users to chat right in the interface. 

📬 XMTP Chat:
We've created a fork of XMTP chat that works seamlessly with the Mask network. This feature allows users to search any connected social accounts and resolve them to an address which can be messaged. Additionally, we've integrated Privy, enabling users to conveniently login with their Apple and Google accounts. Users are able to export their wallet directly from the website too!

📞 Push Chat and Calling:
We've added push chat and calling features. Now, with just a click of a button, you can initiate a chat or a call. This makes communication within the platform even more seamless and efficient.

👑 Governance Module:
We've got a governance module built with Zodiac avatars and works within Gnosis Safe. It's a key piece of the puzzle for making governance protocols lindy.

🔧 Liquidation Engine:
Our liquidation engine works with something called Stability MAI (sMAI for short). It uses user-staked MAI to liquidate loans and uses UniswapV4 hooks to sell the collateral at a certain MAI price.

🔐 Performance Tokens:
This is a versatile contract that uses interest-bearing assets as collateral in lending protocols. It's compatible with SparkLend, the erc4626 sDAI, and also works with Compound lending. The best part? Protocols integrating with us get a cut of the earnings. How cool is that?

🏆 Achievements:
We've innovatively incorporated on-chain achievements into our `Mintable.sol` contract. This enables the creation of unique achievements related to balance, farming, and borrowing. The beauty of it? It's all self-service, eliminating the need for trust-based airdrops. Plus, it's fully interoperable, allowing anyone who connects to NFTs to participate. It's a game-changer in the DeFi space, making it more engaging and rewarding for users.

There's a bunch of other stuff in the codebase too, like contracts and interfaces for vaults and liquidators. But these are the main parts. Hope that helps!
