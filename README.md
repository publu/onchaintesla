🚀 Welcome to our project! 🚀

We're all about revolutionizing the DeFi space. Our codebase is packed with exciting features, all designed to make your DeFi experience smoother, safer, and more profitable. Let's dive into the details:

🔐 PerformanceTokensV2:
This is a cool contract that uses interest-bearing assets as collateral in lending protocols. The best part? Protocols integrating with us get a cut of the earnings. How cool is that?

👑 Governance Module:
We've got a governance module built with Zodiac avatars and works within Gnosis Safe. It's a key piece of the puzzle for making this project lindy.

🔧 Liquidation Engine:
Our liquidation engine works with something called Stability MAI (sMAI for short). It uses user-staked MAI to liquidate loans and uses UniswapV4 hooks to sell the collateral at a certain MAI price.

👥 User Interface:
Our user interface is welcoming and interactive. It uses the NextId RelationService API to get the user's information and allows users to chat right in the interface. We're considering either Push notifications or XMTP services for notifications, with a leaning towards Push because it allows for video chat directly on the page.

There's a bunch of other stuff in the codebase too, like contracts and interfaces for vaults and liquidators. But these are the main parts. Hope that helps!
